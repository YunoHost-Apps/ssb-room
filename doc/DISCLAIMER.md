* Any known limitations, constraints or stuff not working:
    * requires a full dedicated domain and does not support sub-paths
    * currently ony supported on amd64 architecture (until more binaries are built upstream)
    * ssb rooms work best when the app is in public mode. ssb-room has its own user and authentication system, and doesn't need yunohost SSO
